# SoC

The project began with learning about websites for competitive coding - atcoder, codechef, codeforces.
I learned about the standard template library and various data structures.
I read abbout time complexity and saw efficient ways to solve some problems.
Then, I studied dynamic programming and applied to method of memoization to make recursive functions more efficient.
I solved problems from cses and participated in contests on codechef and codeforces.
